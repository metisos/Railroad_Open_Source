However, given the context that the conversation is happening on 2022/12/01, we can infer the day before the conversation as 2022/11/30).\n\nGiven the current date is 2022/12/01 (Thursday) and assuming the day before the conversation was 2022/11/30 (Wednesday), we calculate the difference:\n\n2022/12/01 - 2022/11/30 = 1 day\n\nSince there are 7 days in a week, 1 day is approximately 0.14 weeks (1/7). However, the question asks for the number of weeks, and given that the event occurred just a day before the current date, it's reasonable to round this to the nearest whole number, but since it's less than a week, we can say it was approximately 0 weeks ago in terms of full weeks, but more accurately, it was just 1 day ago, or less than a week ago.\n\nHowever, considering the context provided and the fact that we're looking for how many weeks ago the event occurred, and given that the event occurred on the day before the conversation (which we've established as 2022/11/30), and considering typical interpretations of \"how many weeks ago,\" we should note the event was very close to the current date, essentially just the day before.\n\nGiven the information in the accumulated memories, specifically under 'events', it's mentioned that the friends and family sale at Nordstrom occurred 'On the day before the conversation (Nov 30, 2022)'. Since the current date is 2022/12/01, this means the event was on November 30, which is 1 day before December 1. \n\nTo accurately answer the question based on the provided memories and without assuming information not given, we should note the memories do not explicitly provide the conversation date but imply the day before the conversation was November 30. \n\nGiven the current date (2022/12/01) and the event date implied to be November 30, the event occurred approximately 1 day ago, which is less than a week.
